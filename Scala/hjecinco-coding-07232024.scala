1. Complete the function: `squareDigits` from `???`. Write a program that can square every digit of the given number and concatenate the squared digits to form a new number. Put your answer in a scala file named "<yourid>-square-digits.scala‚Äù.
For example, if we run `9119` through the function, `811181` will come out, because 9 squared is 81 and 1 squared is 1. (81-1-1-81)
Example #2: An input of `765` will return `493625` because 7 squared is 49, 6 squared is 36, and 5 squared is 25. (49-36-25)

4. Complete the function `isAmstrong`.
Armstrong number is a positive n-digit number that is equal to the 
sum of the nth powers of their digits. It is also known as pluperfect, 
or Plus Perfect, or Narcissistic number

Armstrong Number Example

1: 1^1 = 1

2: 2^1 = 2

3: 3^1 = 3

153: 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125+ 27 = 153

125: 1^3 + 2^3 + 5^3 = 1 + 8 + 125 = 134 (Not an Armstrong Number)

1634: 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 = 1 + 1296 + 81 + 256 = 1634
